; Help Project File for README 
;
;  You may edit this file.
;
;  It's probably best not to change the CONTENTS= value 
;  unless you rename the IDH_CONTENTS context string in 
;  the README.DOC file.
;

[OPTIONS]
; The optional ROOT= entry sets the working directory for the Help Compiler 
; ROOT=C:\PROJECT

; The optional BMROOT= entry sets forth the directories which the
; help compiler will search for bitmaps used in the Help system.
;
;BMROOT=C:\APPS\INTERNET\INETNAV\HLP\README

; The CONTENTS= tells the help Engine which topic contains the contents 

; Title is Displayed in the Title Bar of WINHELP.EXE
TITLE=Internet Navigator Readme Help

; The BUILD= setting allows complex Help systems which require
; different versions to use the same source.  This is similar to #ifdef's 
; in the 'C' language.  Everything to the right of the = sign in the 
; BUILD= statement is an EXPRESSION.  See the Help compiler 
; documentation for more information about build expressions.

; The Warning Level is used by the Help Compiler (HC.EXE)
; WARNING=1  - Only the most severe warnings are reported
; WARNING=2  - Intermediate Level of warnings
; WARNING=3  - Most stringent error reporting
WARNING=3

; The Compress option is used by the Help Compiler to make 
; smaller, faster loading .HLP files.  However, using compression
; increases Compile times.
; COMPRESS=YES, ON, OFF, NO, TRUE or FALSE

[BUILDTAGS]
; The Build Tags section specifies to the Help Compiler the names
; of all the valid build tags used in this Help project.  The [BUILDTAGS]
; section is optional.


[CONFIG]
; The config section allows you to define some macros which will be
; executed when the help system is first executed.
;
; The next line gives you browse buttons:
;

;
; To create a glossary button which displays a list of defined terms
; in a secondary window, remove the semi colon at the start of the next
; line and do the same with the Glossary window in the [WINDOWS] section
;CreateButton("Glossary_Btn","&Glossary","JI(`bubble.hlp>Gloss',`IDH_Glossary')")
;
;
; The next line creates a button which jumps to the glossary topic.
;



BrowseButtons()
CreateButton("btn_glossary","&Glossary","JumpId(`readme.hlp>glossary',`glossary_contents')")
[FILES]
; The files section is where you specify to the Help Compiler which
; Rich Text Format (.RTF) (your help source) files will be used in the
; Help system.  RoboHELP generates and maintains the main .RTF 
; file for your Help System.  If you desire to have multiple .RTF files,
; simply add the additonal names to the [FILES] section.

README.RTF
C:\APPS\INTERNET\INETNAV\HLP\GLOSSARY.RTF
[ALIAS]
; The Alias  section allows you to set up aliases for context strings 
; in your help system.  
; 
; Brief example:
; 
;    IDH_UserID = IDH_RoboGenerated_Id
;    IDH_WMP_MenuID = IDH_RoboGenerated_Id
;    IDH_Any = IDH_AnyOther

[MAP]
; 
; The Map Section is where the C language #defines are translated 
; or mapped into the Help System Context Strings.  Standard C syntax
; can be employed.  The .HH file is meant to be #include(d) into your 
; Windows application source code.
; 

[BITMAPS]
; 
; The [BITMAPS] section is where you list any Bitmaps which have
; been placed by reference in the Help System.  See the Help compiler
; documentation for more information about placing bitmaps.
; 
; The [BITMAPS] section is not really required under Windows 3.1,
; with the advent of the BMROOT item in the [OPTIONS] section.
; 
;FOO1.BMP
;FOO2.BMP
;C:\FOO\FOO3.BMP
;And So On

[WINDOWS]
; Windows Help can display help in one of 5 secondary windows.
; Before using a secondary window, the window must be defined
; in this section:
; 
;Gloss = "Glossary",(100,100,350,350),0,(255,255,255),(255,255,255)

glossary="Readme Help Glossary",(252,56,716,909),0,(255,255,255),(192,192,192)
main=,(59,756,105,123),1,(255,255,255),(192,192,192)
[BAGGAGE]
; 
; The Baggage section allows the user to include files which
; will be placed in the internal file system for WinHelp.  
; Using files from Baggage is a little faster for CDROM, since
; the CDROM drive table does not need to be read from disk.
;
; Baggage files are referred to as regular bitmaps, except
; that you prefix the filename with '!'.
;
;    For Instance:
;       {bmc !bitmap.bmp} instead of {bmc bitmap.bmp}
;
